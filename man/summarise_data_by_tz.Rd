\title{Summarize Trainer Availability by Timezone Group and Quarter}
\usage{
summarise_data_by_tz(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe; Contains original trainer data including availability and timezones.
Must have columns that can be mapped to 'availability' and 'timezones' by the
map_availability() and map_timezones() functions, respectively.}
}
\value{
Dataframe; A new data frame containing the number of trainers in each timezone group,
broken down by availability status, and grouped by year and quarter.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame with trainer availability and timezone information,
applies mapping and summarization operations, and returns a new data frame.
The summarized data is grouped by year, quarter, timezone group, and availability status.
Note that the year and quarter are currently hard-coded as "2034" and "1", respectively.

\dontrun{
  # Assuming 'trainer_data' is a data frame with availability and timezone info
  summarized_data <- summarise_data_by_tz(trainer_data)
  print(summarized_data)

\title{Summarize Trainer Availability by Quarter}
\usage{
summarise_data_by_qtr(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe; The original data frame containing trainer availability data.
Must contain a column that can be mapped to 'availability' by the map_availability() function.}
}
\value{
Dataframe; A new data frame containing the number of trainers available,
maybe available, and not available, grouped by year and quarter.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame containing trainer availability data, processes it,
and returns a summarized version. The summary is grouped by year, quarter, and availability status.
Currently, the year and quarter are hard-coded as "2034" and "1", respectively.
}

  # Assuming 'trainer_data' is a data frame containing availability info
  summarized_data <- summarise_data_by_qtr(trainer_data)
  print(summarized_data)
